# Frontend Operator Migration Guide

The configurations for navigation, module configuration, search, service tiles, and others are now deprecated. The configuration files will be generated via the Frontend Operator. Configuration partials are embedded into the Frontend resource file. This file is mandatory for frontends to deploy to the HCC platform.

This documentation only describes the migration steps. If you are looking for detailed documentation about the spec and how to use it, please see the [frontend starter app docs](https://github.com/RedHatInsights/frontend-starter-app/blob/master/docs/frontend-operator/index.md).

## Multiple Environment Configurations

The Chrome service has a separate configuration file for each environment. Because the environment configuration is generated based on the existing Frontend resources in a cluster within the frontend namespace, this is no longer a requirement. The recommended approach is to have a single configuration defined by the Frontend resources. If, however, your project requires a separate configuration file for whatever reason, a new deployment file has to be created and referenced in the app interface configuration within the frontend repository.

## Enabling FEO for Configuration Generation

In order to enable the new FEO features, the frontend has to "opt in". Only then will the Frontend Operator start using the Frontend resource to generate the Chrome UI configuration.

Example of how to enable the Frontend Operator features:

```yaml
# deploy/frontend.yaml configuration if in a frontend repository
# unrelated attributes are omitted
objects:
  - spec:
      feoConfigEnabled: true # flags a frontend to be ready for FEO features
```

## fed-modules.json Replacement

The basic configuration of a frontend module was defined in the `static/stable/<env>/modules/fed-modules.json`. This configuration needs to be split and moved over to the Frontend resource configuration. Usually, frontends have a `deploy/frontend.yaml` file in their repository ([starter app example](https://github.com/RedHatInsights/frontend-starter-app/blob/master/docs/frontend-operator/index.md/blob/master/deploy/frontend.yaml)).

Currently, your application may have already defined a "fed-modules.json replacement entry". **This configuration is likely out of date or refers to the starter app!**.

The configuration should be added/updated at `objects[0].spec.module`. Configuration can be simply copied from the existing `fed-modules.json`. For example, the Frontend resource module config migration for the Learning Resources UI module should look like this:

```js
// existing learning resources configuration in static/stable/stage/modules/fed-modules.json

{
  // the entire entry under the "learningResources" key can be transferred to the frontend/deploy.yaml in the learning resources repository
  "learningResources": {
      "manifestLocation": "/apps/learning-resources/fed-mods.json",
      "modules": [
          {
              "id": "learningResources",
              "module": "./RootApp",
              "routes": [
                  {
                      "pathname": "/openshift/learning-resources",
                      "props": {
                          "bundle": "openshift"
                      }
                  },
                  {
                      "pathname": "/ansible/learning-resources",
                      "props": {
                          "bundle": "ansible"
                      }
                  },
                  {
                      "pathname": "/insights/learning-resources",
                      "props": {
                          "bundle": "insights"
                      }
                  },
                  {
                      "pathname": "/edge/learning-resources",
                      "props": {
                          "bundle": "edge"
                      }
                  },
                  {
                      "pathname": "/settings/learning-resources",
                      "props": {
                          "bundle": "settings"
                      }
                  },
                  {
                      "pathname": "/iam/learning-resources",
                      "props": {
                          "bundle": "iam"
                      }
                  },
                  {
                      "pathname": "/hac/learning-resources",
                      "props": {
                          "bundle": "hac"
                      }
                  },
                  {
                      "pathname": "/subscriptions/learning-resources",
                      "props": {
                          "bundle": "subscriptions"
                      }
                  },
                  {
                      "pathname": "/application-services/learning-resources",
                      "props": {
                          "bundle": "application-services"
                      }
                  }
              ]
          },
          {
            "id": "learningResourcesGlobal",
            "module": "./GlobalLearningResourcesPage",
            "routes": [
                {
                    "pathname": "/staging/global-learning-resources-page"
                }
            ]
          },
          {
             "id": "learningResourcesCreator",
             "module": "./Creator",
             "routes": [
                 {
                     "pathname": "/staging/learning-resources-creator"
                 }
             ]
          }
      ]
  },
}

```

The `deploy/frontend.yaml` file module config will have the following format:

```yaml
# unrelated attributes are omitted to reduce the size of the example
objects:
  - spec:
      module:
        manifestLocation: "/apps/learning-resources/fed-mods.json"
        modules:
        - id: learningResources
          module: "./RootApp"
          routes:
          - pathname: "/openshift/learning-resources"
            props:
              bundle: openshift
          - pathname: "/ansible/learning-resources"
            props:
              bundle: ansible
          - pathname: "/insights/learning-resources"
            props:
              bundle: insights
          - pathname: "/edge/learning-resources"
            props:
              bundle: edge
          - pathname: "/settings/learning-resources"

          - pathname: "/iam/learning-resources"
            props:
              bundle: iam
          - pathname: "/hac/learning-resources"

              bundle: hac
          - pathname: "/subscriptions/learning-resources"
            props:
              bundle: subscriptions
          - pathname: "/application-services/learning-resources"
            props:
              bundle: application-services
        - id: learningResourcesGlobal
          module: "./GlobalLearningResourcesPage"
          routes:
          - pathname: "/staging/global-learning-resources-page"
        - id: learningResourcesCreator
          module: "./Creator"
          routes:
          - pathname: "/staging/learning-resources-creator"

```

## Navigation Items Migration

Currently, the Chrome left-hand navigation is defined in "bundles" in the `static/stable/<env>/navigation/<bundle>-navigation.json`.

The Frontend Operator scans each Frontend resource for "bundle segments" or "navigation segments" and generates the bundles from them.

To learn about the navigation and bundle segments and their options, please read [frontend starter app docs](https://github.com/RedHatInsights/frontend-starter-app/blob/master/docs/frontend-operator/index.md).

### Migration Steps:

1. Make sure that relevant navigation items in navigation files in this repository have **a unique ID**. The ID attribute is mandatory in the Frontend Operator.

2. Transfer the navigation metadata to the `deploy/frontend.yaml` or its equivalent in your project repository. Bundle segments and navigation segments have to be properly identified. A detailed description of both can be found in the [frontend starter app docs](https://github.com/RedHatInsights/frontend-starter-app/blob/master/docs/frontend-operator/index.md).

Example of a bundle segment from the Learning Resources app:

```yaml
# deploy/frontend.yaml in learning resources repository
# unrelated attributes are omitted

objects:
  - spec:
      bundleSegments:
        - segmentId: learning-resources-settings
          bundleId: settings
          position: 300
          navItems:
            id: learningResources
            title: Learning Resources
            href: /settings/learning-resources
        - segmentId: learning-resources-insights
          bundle: insights
          position: 900
          navItems:
            id: learningResources
            title: Learning Resources
            href: /insights/learning-resources
            product: Red Hat Insights
```

Any navigation items structure is currently accepted as a valid bundle segment navigation item.

In case there should be a "foreign" navigation item in your bundle segment with a **flat nav items structure** (not expandable or a group), it is highly recommended to split the navigation items into multiple bundle segments to remove any dependency between the UI modules!

In case your navigation is nested and it includes "foreign" navigation items (from a different UI repository and thus different Frontend resource), navigation segments can be injected from such a "foreign" module to bundle segments.

An example of "navigation segment injection":

```yaml
# unrelated attributes are omitted 
# a bundle segment definition in module A with nested navigation dependency from module B

# module-A Frontend spec
objects:
  - spec:
      metadata:
        name: module-A
      bundleSegments:
        segmentId: module-A-bundle-segment-A
        bundleId: foo
        position: 444
        navItems:
          - id: local-nav-item
            title: Local Nav Item
            href: /foo/bar
          - id: local-expandable-nav-item
            title: Expandable
            expandable: true
            routes:
              - id: local-nested-one
                title: Local Nested One
                href: /foo/bar/local-one
              # this is a reference to a "foreign" navigation segment
              # both the segment ID and the frontend name have to be specified
              - segmentRef:
                  frontendName: module-B
                  segmentId: module-B-segment-A
              - id: local-nested-two
                title: Local Nested Two
                href: /foo/nar/nested-two

# module-B Frontend spec
objects:
  - spec:
      metadata:
        name: module-B
      # no bundle segments
      # navigation segments have to be explicitly referenced otherwise they won't be used
      navigationSegments:
        - segmentId: module-B-segment-A
          navItems:
            - id: foreign-nested-one
              title: Foreign Nested One
              href: /foo/bar/foreign-one
            - id: foreign-nested-two
              title: Foreign Nested Two
              href: /foo/bar/foreign-two

# The FEO will merge the segments into the module-A-bundle-segment-A bundle segment.
# The result of the merge will look like this:

objects:
  - spec:
      metadata:
        name: module-A
      bundleSegments:
        segmentId: module-A-bundle-segment-A
        bundleId: foo
        position: 444
        navItems:
          - id: local-nav-item
            title: Local Nav Item
            href: /foo/bar
          - id: local-expandable-nav-item
            title: Expandable
            expandable: true
            routes:
              - id: local-nested-one
                title: Local Nested One
                href: /foo/bar/local-one
                # The nav items were injected into the segment ref position
              - id: foreign-nested-one
                title: Foreign Nested One
                href: /foo/bar/foreign-one
              - id: foreign-nested-two
                title: Foreign Nested Two
                href: /foo/bar/foreign-two
              - id: local-nested-two
                title: Local Nested Two
                href: /foo/nar/nested-two
```

3. Mark navigation items for "replacement" inside the navigation files. Because of a long migration period during which both static and operator-generated configuration files have to be supported, navigation items in a bundle have to be "marked for replacement" within a bundle until the entire bundle navigation is migrated over.

To an **existing top-level navigation item** in a bundle, add a `feoReplacement` attribute. The attribute value is an `id` of a navigation item from a corresponding bundle segment nav item.

An example:

```js
// staging-navigation.json

{
    "id": "staging",
    "title": "Staging Bundle",
    "navItems": [
        {
            "id": "frontend-starter-app",
            "title": "Starter App",
            "appId": "frontend-starter-app",
            "href": "/staging/starter",
            // this is a reference to a nav item ID from a bundle segment
            "feoReplacement": "frontend-starter-app"
        },
        // ....
    ]
}
```

```yaml
# frontend starter app deploy/frontend.yaml sample

objects:
    spec:
        - segmentId: starter-app
          bundleId: staging
          position: 100
          navItems:
              # ID referenced in the "feo-replacement" attribute
            - id: frontend-starter-app
              title: Starter App Link
              href: /staging/starter
```

Once all top-level navigation items in a bundle have a "feoReplacement" reference, the navigation file can be removed and only the generated output will be used. During the migration window, it has to be ensured that all bundle segments have their equivalent top-level nav items in a corresponding static navigation file. 

## Services Dropdown Replacement

In the current approach, the services dropdown data is partially using navigation items references and static tiles definition.

The new approach no longer allows using navigation items references. This approach caused unexpected changes to the services dropdown and is discontinued. In the Frontend resource, services dropdown tiles have to be explicitly defined and placed into a section and a group.

Current definition can be found at `static/stable/<env>/services/services.json`. This file is a template including the navigation items references and it outputs a `static/stable/<env>/services/services-generated.json` after the `make parse-services` CLI command is triggered.

To migrate, follow these steps:

1. Make sure the referenced link or the statically defined entry has the `id` attribute.

2. Run the `parse-services` to generate the `services-generated.json` or look at the response payload of https://console.stage.redhat.com/api/chrome-service/v1/static/stable/stage/services/services-generated.json response.

3. Transfer the corresponding configuration from the `services-generated.json` to the Frontend resource. Only a subset of attributes is valid for the Frontend resources. There is no need for all navigation items attributes as most of them are not used.

Example migration:

```js
// services-generated.json snippet
[
  {
    "description": "Solve problems once, in one place, and scale up.",
    "icon": "AutomationIcon",
    // This is a section attribute
    "id": "automation",
    "links": [
      {
        // this is a group attribute
        "id": "rhel",
        "isGroup": true,
        "links": [
          {
            // example of unnecessary attribute for the service tile
            "alt_title": [
              "Remediate",
              "playbook",
              "fix",
              "solve",
              "find it fix it",
              "fifi",
              "cloud connector",
              "insights",
              "automation",
              "Ansible",
              "patch"
            ],
            "appId": "remediations",
            "description": "Use Ansible Playbooks to resolve configuration, security, and compliance issues identified on your Red Hat Enterprise Linux systems.",
            "href": "/insights/remediations",
            "icon": "InsightsIcon",
            "id": "remediations",
            "product": "Red Hat Insights",
            "subtitle": "Red Hat Insights for RHEL",
            "title": "Remediations"
          },
          // ... other configuration
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

```yaml
objects:
    spec:
      serviceTiles:
        - id: remediations
          # place service tile into the automation section 
          section: automation
          # place service tile into the ansible group within the automation section
          group: ansible
          title: Remediations
          href: /insights/remediations
          description: Use Ansible Playbooks to resolve configuration, security, and compliance issues identified on your Red Hat Enterprise Linux systems.
          icon: InsightsIcon
```

The entry should be removed from the services.json static template.

## Search Index Migration

### Pre-requisites

The search index is currently generated from:
1. The service.json template.
2. Statically defined entries in `cmd/search/static-services-entries.json`.

In the FEO approach, search entries have to be explicitly defined. The data is no longer inferred from the services dropdown data. To prevent duplicate entries, make sure the service tiles entries were migrated and the entry was removed from the `service.json` template and the `static-services-entries.json` files.

### Migration Steps

1. Make sure the services dropdown tiles of the affected UI module were removed from the `services.json` template and from the static `static-services-entries.json` files.
2. Define search entries in the `deploy/frontend.yaml` file or its equivalent.

Example of search entries config:

```yaml
# unrelated attributes are omitted
objects:
  - spec:
      searchEntries:
        - id: "starter"
          title: "Starter App FEO Testing Link"
          href: /staging/foo/starter
          description: "An experimental link to test FEO features integration"
          alt_title:
            - Starter
            - Starter App

```
