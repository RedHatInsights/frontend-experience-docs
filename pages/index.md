# Frontend Experience Documentation

This repository serves as a centralized hub for the **Platform Experience UI team's** best practices, guidelines, and general knowledge sharing. The goal is to maintain consistency across projects, improve collaboration, and facilitate onboarding for new team members.

**The information contributed there is published in the inScope docs**
- [prod](https://inscope.corp.redhat.com/docs/default/component/frontend-experience-docs/)
- [stage](https://inscope.corp.stage.redhat.com/docs/default/component/frontend-experience-docs/)

---

### What should be included:
- **Best practices** for frontend development
- **Knowledge-sharing videos** and outputs from similar discussions or meetings
- **General useful information** contributed by team members

### What shouldn't be included:
- **Service-specific content**

  *Each application's/service's documentation should be maintained separately within its repository. This ensures a clean separation between high-level guidelines and individual application details.*

---

## How to contribute

If you'd like to add new content to the documentation:
1. **Create a new Markdown file (`*.md`)** inside the `/pages` folder.
2. **Update the `mkdocs.yml` file** to include a reference to your new file, ensuring it gets added to the documentation structure.
