### Filters:

- TO BE ADDED...

## Sentry {#sentry}

When an error occurs on the frontend, there should be a request ID that pairs up with the sentry ID. You can [go to Sentry](https://sentry.io/organizations/console-dot/) to figure out the root cause of the bug as well as the breadcrumbs on what happened.

A lot of this info is also on the \#consoledot-sentry-ui channel

# Developer Workflow

## Git

We primarily use GitHub for all of our git based activities. There are also instances where we need to use GitLab (internal things).

* You can find our **GitHub** org [here](https://github.com/RedHatInsights/)   
* You can find our **GitLab** org [here](https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/insights-platform)  
  * [QE GitLab](https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/insights-qe/)

You should be enrolled in the \#platform-experience-ui team in GitHub which will give you write access to any repository that Platform Experience owns

[As previously mentioned, we use Sentry to log errors](#sentry)
